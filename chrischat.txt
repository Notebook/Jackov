7:24 AM - =KoL= spOOky: then project management
7:24 AM - Composition Notebook: First off
7:24 AM - Composition Notebook: I wasn't entirely sure what you meant by Project Management
7:24 AM - =KoL= spOOky: like
7:24 AM - =KoL= spOOky: a list of projects
7:24 AM - =KoL= spOOky: and admins have the ability to add / remove them
7:24 AM - =KoL= spOOky: update the status
7:24 AM - =KoL= spOOky: descriptions
7:24 AM - =KoL= spOOky: etc

7:37 AM - Composition Notebook: config folder, includes folder, etc
7:37 AM - =KoL= spOOky: oh
7:37 AM - =KoL= spOOky: maybe
7:37 AM - =KoL= spOOky: /users/
7:37 AM - =KoL= spOOky: /admin/
7:38 AM - =KoL= spOOky: /core/ or /engine/ or something else
7:38 AM - =KoL= spOOky: /uploads/ if we include file upload
7:38 AM - =KoL= spOOky: and /styles/ if we include a templating system
7:41 AM - Composition Notebook: Okay

7:41 AM - =KoL= spOOky: kewl
7:41 AM - =KoL= spOOky: dont 4get /users/ and /admin/
7:41 AM - Composition Notebook: I don't think it quite fits in the other two directories
7:41 AM - Composition Notebook: I'm contemplating that
7:42 AM - =KoL= spOOky: whys that
7:42 AM - Composition Notebook: It may just be because I don't understand your reasoning for that
7:42 AM - =KoL= spOOky: go on
7:42 AM - Composition Notebook: Are you saying that for like /users/ for usercp things and /admin/ for admin cp things?
7:42 AM - =KoL= spOOky: basically
